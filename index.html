      <h2>welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        i'm a computer science major from new jersey, currently attending
        lafayette college in easton, pa. in my free time, i like to work out,
        play video games, and meet new people. i have a strong interest in
        geography, vexillology, and linguistics, which have had heavy prevalence
        over my life and projects. i'm also really into entrepreneurship, where
        i even have a business of my own! i'm always up for a good conversation,
        so feel free to reach out. hope to talk soon! last updated sept 2024.
